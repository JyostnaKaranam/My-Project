## Introduction

The main purpose of our project Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation System is to familiarize candidates with interview scenarios, helping them improve their responses, boost confidence, and refine their communication skills.
The system aims to boost candidates' confidence, improve their interview performance, and provide recruiters with efficient pre-screening capabilities.
The system supports text- based and audio-based answers, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of a candidate‚Äôs skills
The system is developed using Streamlit and Python and leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze resumes, generate relevant interview questions, and evaluate responses. 
It enhances the recruitment process by ensuring data-driven decision-making and skill-based assessment.
